# MDO-oversampling

This repository contains an implemenatation of the MDO-oversampling algorithm proposed by Sattar Hashemi and Lida Abdi.

The paper tries to solve the problem of bad classification results on unbalanced datasets by proposing the use of  **Mahalanobis distance** in the calculation of the **Covariance** in place of **Euclidean distance**. Through this, there will be proportionate amount of oversampling of under-represented classes and undersampling of over-represented classes.
